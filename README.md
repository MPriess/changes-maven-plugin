# Maven Changes Plugin

## Deploy change logs

Reads human-written CHANGES.txt, and pulls out change log entries for the
current project version, and deploys a change log for those with the project.

## Combining change logs

Pulls in deployed change logs from other Maven projects, and combines them
into a master change log.
